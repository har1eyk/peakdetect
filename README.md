# peakdetect
###What is PeakDetect?
peakdetect.py is a Python script used to detects peaks in timeseries or linear data. 
###What is the Source?
I originally found the script on Github. I believe it was based off a MatLab script. However, I can no longer find the script on Github. I managed to find it here: https://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/68268766/. I don't know if this is the original source. I'd like to give credit, but I don't know where credit is due.
